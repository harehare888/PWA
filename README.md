# PWA
Make sites that are not PWA-compliant similar to PWAs.

# Usage Method
1. Upload an image with size 192px x 192px and name icon.png.
This will be the icon.

2. Edit line 14 of redirect.html along lines 15 and 16. Also, change https://google.com/ on lines 23, 25, and 31 to the URL of the page you want to redirect to.

3. Edit the HERE section of manifest.webmanifest as shown in the item.
The color is represented as #XXXXXXXX and the name and short_name can be the same.

4. Don't forget to add icon.png and upload the five files to your web server.
You do not need to add README.md.

5. This completes the process!
